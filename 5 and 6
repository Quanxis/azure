Create and implement networking design for three tiered application and required NSGs. Database uses port 3306/TCP, frontend and backend both use port 8000/UDP.
Designing a network for a three-tier application in Microsoft Azure involves creating a secure and scalable environment. 
This setup typically includes a web frontend, an application backend, and a database tier. Each tier will be isolated in its own subnet within a virtual network, ensuring that services are segregated for security and manageability. Hereâ€™s how you can design and implement this:

1. Azure Virtual Network and Subnets
Virtual Network (VNet): Create a VNet named VNetApp with an address space that can accommodate three subnets. For example, you could use 10.10.0.0/16.

Subnets:

Web Frontend Subnet: 10.10.1.0/24
Application Backend Subnet: 10.10.2.0/24
Database Subnet: 10.10.3.0/24
2. Network Security Groups (NSGs)
For each subnet, create a Network Security Group (NSG) to enforce security rules that allow traffic to only necessary services:

Web Frontend NSG: WebNSG

Inbound Rules:
Allow UDP on port 8000 from the Internet (0.0.0.0/0) for client access.
Outbound Rules:
Allow UDP on port 8000 to the Application Backend Subnet (10.10.2.0/24).
Application Backend NSG: AppNSG

Inbound Rules:
Allow UDP on port 8000 from the Web Frontend Subnet (10.10.1.0/24).
Outbound Rules:
Allow TCP on port 3306 to the Database Subnet (10.10.3.0/24).
Database NSG: DBNSG

Inbound Rules:
Allow TCP on port 3306 from the Application Backend Subnet (10.10.2.0/24).
Outbound Rules:
Restrict all outbound traffic as a best practice unless specific outbound traffic is required.
3. Azure Resources
Virtual Machines: Deploy VMs in each subnet according to their roles:

Web Frontend VMs: In the Web Frontend Subnet.
Application Backend VMs: In the Application Backend Subnet.
Database Servers: In the Database Subnet.
Load Balancers: If required, place a load balancer in front of the Web Frontend and another in front of the Application Backend for scalability and high availability.

4. Implementation Steps
Create the Virtual Network and Subnets:

Navigate to the Azure Portal.
Create VNetApp and add the subnets as described.
Create NSGs and Assign Rules:

Create each NSG in the Azure Portal.
Assign the NSGs to their respective subnets.
Configure the rules as specified.
Deploy VMs and Other Resources:

Deploy VMs for each tier within their respective subnets.
Configure the VMs according to their roles (e.g., install web server software on frontend VMs, application runtime on backend VMs, and database software on DB servers).
Testing and Validation:

Test connectivity between tiers using tools like ping (if ICMP is allowed) or specific client software that can connect to the respective ports.
Ensure that the application behaves as expected with the NSGs enforcing the network traffic rules.
